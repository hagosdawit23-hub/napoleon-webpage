  Despite his many victories, Napoleon’s ambition led to wars across Europe. His invasion of Russia in 1812 was a turning point, resulting in heavy losses for the French army. After a series of defeats, he was finally exiled to the island of Elba, escaped, and returned to power briefly during the Hundred Days before his final defeat at Waterloo in 1815.
